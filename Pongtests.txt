'Pong' App Tests:

	1) Make sure the app works

	2) Make sure each menu button functions as intended
		- Play button should take you to the Config screen (where it allows you to set player names)
		- About button should take you to the About screen (this screen should show you the developers)
		- Help button should take you to the Help screen (this screen should tell you about the game)
		- Leaderboard button should take you to a screen with only a back button
		
	3) Make sure the Back button on each screen takes you to the Home screen (the initial screen)

	4) Make sure the Play Now button (on the Config screen) takes you to the Pong app

	5) Each players name should be shown above their respective scores (up to 10 characters)

	6) Make sure the Menu button functions as intended
		- The game should pause and a menu should pop up
		- Exit button on menu will not function correctly (still working on it)
		- Resume button should resume the game where it left off
		
	7) Each Pong Paddle should be movable by touch / mouse

	8) When the ball hits anything, it should bounce in the same manner a normal ball would bounce

	9) When the ball passes one of the paddles, the opposing player's score should increment by 1
	
	10) When a player hits 3 points scored, the game should pause, and the winner's name should be displayed

	11) I'm not sure how you should exit the game (lol)
